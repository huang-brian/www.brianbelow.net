Everything below this line is your actual blog post content. 

You can use **standard markdown** here:
* Lists for your musings.
* [Links to other sites](https://google.com).
* *Italics for emphasis.*

[cite_start]Since no photo was provided in the "Front Matter" for some posts, the template we built will automatically insert a short excerpt here instead.
